["Hello World!" Sketch](https://kyleeckoch01.github.io/120-work/hw-3)

This week we looked more into the world of p5.js.  We learned about background colors and how to do text.  I followed along with all of the videos so that I could get a clear understanding as to how to complete this project to the best of my ability and also to make sure I understood how to effectively do the required material.  I did not really have any issues with this project, the tutorials were easy to follow along with making it easy for me to complete the work.  I am excited to dig deeper into the world of p5.js and discover all of the different things we can accomplish in the program.  I did not help any other classmates this cycle, nor did I need any help from any of my classmates.
