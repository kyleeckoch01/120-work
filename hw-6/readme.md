I found this week's work to be quite difficult, as math is not a specialty of mine.  I struggled to incorporate everything that I needed to in my project because I could not get it all to come together and become one whole project, so I just worked with what I could figure out how to do, and I am fairly satisfied with my result.  My piece gives a feeling of chaos, which I feel is very fitting for the process I went through to create it.

This week my steps were:
-look through the course website to learn the new material
-looked at some of my fellow classmates creations and their codes to see how they created it
-looked stuff up on p5.js
-started to play around and experiment with my coding
-continuously referenced the website throughout my creation
-made my piece to the best of my ability
-did my read.me
-submitted my work
