For this weeks homework I spend a lot of my time experimenting with the different animations that can be used in p5.  I kept it pretty basic with my design so that I could make sure to get the hang of making my robot animated.  I went through all of the course directions for this week and thoroughly read and did my research, and then I began my project.  I had a difficult time getting my head to spin, but I looked through the directions again and also referred to the code that was given to us and I figured out how to go about making my robots head spin.  Basically just learning how to animate things and make them come to "life" really stood out to me in this lesson.  I continue to be mesmerized by all of the different things we are able to achieve in p5, and I really enjoy learning all of the different things we can do.  I referred back to last weeks homework and read a few of the comments my fellow classmates had posted, just to expand my knowledge and learn different techniques that they used to achieve their creations.
