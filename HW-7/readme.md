- Line 3 sets the the ball object and lines 4-10 are defining variables
-Lines 12-14 are calling the function setup and then setting up the background width/height and the background color
-lines 19-22 are stting a new value for ball.x and ball.y
-Line 25-29 are setting the height and width for the ball.x and ball.y variables
-Lines 33-34 are drawing the ellipse and also setting the color that it should be
-Lines 37-39 are setting the path that the ball is taking on the screen and also setting the function changing what the ball does when the mouse is pushed


I altered the sketch by changing the background color to black to make the colors of the ball pop more.  I also changed the color of the ball to yellow, white, and orange and set the colors to change at certain points on the screen.  I also changed the windowHeight to 600 to make it a bit larger.
