Kylee Koch section 50


This week I went through the course material to really make sure that I understood the information.  I read through the explanations and the example codes to get an idea of what my project need to look like.  After I did this, I tried to figure out what I wanted to do.  I decided I wanted to keep it simple so that I could really get a good understanding of the information, so I just stuck with making balls that interact with each other and change colors once they hit one another.  I struggled a little bit at first getting my project to come together, but I realized it was just a couple of my own errors in my code that were making it not work, so I fixed those and had my completed project.  Once I did that, I created this and then submitted my project to github and the lesson forum.  My only problems I really faced were just my own coding errors, which were easy to fix once I found them (which is the hardest part).  Overall I really enjoyed this weeks content.
