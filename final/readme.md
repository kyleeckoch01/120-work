Final Project sketch

The Idea
For my final project I decided I wanted to do something space themed.  In my proposal I planned to show the planets orbits around the sun, and I also hoped to add some music.  I wanted to make this because I was originally inspired by the project example "Round Visualization" and how it was animated.  As it turns out, I chose to animate my project in a different way than originally intended, but as it turned out, I think I like my chose in animating the stars rather than the planets better.  

The Good
I really like how my project turned out visually.  It is simple (like most of my work in this class has been), but it is also fun to look at.  I did not have too many struggles creating this piece once I finally decided on what I wanted to do which made this much less stressful to create than I thought it would be.  The stars are my favorite part of this project because of how they move.  The movement gives them the look of "twinkling" which is fun, and I also like how it gives a more serious concept (the planets and their orbits) a fun twist.

The Bad
I had originally intended to animate the planets and have them orbit the sun, but when I tried this, it looked like a jumbled mess and was aesthetically pleasing to me.  I also had intended on adding some music in the background just to incorporate a new idea we were given, but as much as I tried to do this it would not upload correctly for me and my page kept saying "Loading...".  This really frustrated me because I did a ton of research on how to successfully get the music uploaded but nothing seemed to work, so I decided to stop focusing my time on that one aspect and focus on creating an exciting project without the music.  

Help while creating
I watched a lot of youtube videos to help me learn how to create my piece.  My main bulk of looking for help was when I was trying to add sound to my piece, but I also needed some help when it came to originally making the planets orbit.  Once none of these worked out in my favor, I decided to use my own knowledge from the class to create my final piece.  I did refer to the course website to refresh my memory on some things, and I also used to p5 reference page to help me out as well.  

Overall, I am thrilled with how my project came out.  I got to incorporate a lot of different aspects in to it that I have learned over the semester, and it was fun to be able to create something completely out of scratch and with no set guidelines.  I never thought that I would enjoy coding as much as I do, I definitely gained an appreciation for the concept, and also respect for people that can create such extensive/creative projects with p5.js.
