I enjoyed the flexibility that we were given this week.  We were able to try out p5 on our own without step by step directions, which made it challenging, but also very beneficial in the learning process because we had to problem solve and figure out what worked best for our creations.

The process I went through to create my piece was:
1. I read through the course materials and instructions
2. Drew out what I wanted to self portrait to look like
3. Started playing around in p5 and trying out different things
4. Finished up my portrait
5. Finished this read.me
6. Uploaded my files to GitHub and to the discussion forum
