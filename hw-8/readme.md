Kylee Koch, section 50

This week I went through the course materials to understand what new things we were learning about. I then made sure I understood all that we were trying to accomplish, and then went and took a look at what some of my classmates had created.  I then decided on what I thought would be a cool idea and created it.  I did not face many problems this week, as it was fairly easy material and we were given the choice to go whichever direction we wanted to and create something all of our own.  I enjoyed the fact this was an easy week and gave us a little break from the past few weeks that have been filled with a lot of material.  I did not help any classmates out this week, but it was nice to look at my classmates work and get an idea of things that they created to help inspire me to create my own piece.
