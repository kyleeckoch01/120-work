Kylee Koch, section 50

Propsal
I want to create something that is space themed.  I am going to do a thing showing the planets orbiting the sun.  I will have to create each individual planet, and then closely match each one's orbit around the sun.  I was inspired to do this idea after seeing the example provided for us called "Round Visualization".  I found that project to be super appealing visually, so I wanted to do something kind of like that.  I may try and some music just for an extra effect to the project as a whole.

Problems
I think this will be a challenge for me, this whole class has challenged me thus far, but I always seem to work through it and figure it out. I think that the hardest part will be getting the planets to move exactly in the direction I want them to, but I plan on using outside resources to help me work through it and figure it out.  It will also be a challenge to add music since I have yet to do that in this class, but once I figure it out I think it will turn out super cool.

Work plan
I will begin this project probably the 30th, and work on it progressively after that point until I finish it.  I want to have it done by the 10th at the latest, just to make sure that I can upload it properly and have no complications that would prolong the turning in process.  I have yet to start on my project yet, as coming up with an idea has taken me some time, but now that I have one I am ready to go!
